# Usage
Sci-Fi Calc brings advanced mathematical functions to your fingertips, converting a standard calculator into a powerful scientific calculator. To make the most out of this enhanced tool, follow these usage guidelines:

## Trigonometric Functions
- For using trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and cosec, first enter the desired value, and then press the corresponding function button to obtain the result.
## Inverse Trigonometric Functions
- To calculate the inverse trigonometric functions (sin-1, cos-1, tan-1), input the value and then press the respective function button.
## Exponential Function (x^y)
- To perform the exponentiation operation (x^y), start by entering the base value (x). Then, press the function button "x^y" and provide the exponent value (y) to compute the result.
## Special Functions
- For the following functions (x^2, âˆšx, ln, log, 1/x, x!), input a number as the value of 'x', and then press the corresponding function button to obtain the calculated result.
## Brackets Support
- Sci-Fi Calc adheres to the BODMAS rule, allowing you to use parentheses for complex expressions and calculations.
## Power of 10 (10^x)
- To calculate the value of 10 raised to the power of 'x', first enter the value of 'x', then press the "10^x" function button to get the result.
## Nth Root Function (yâˆšx)
- For the nth root function, first enter the value of 'y' (root), then press the "yâˆšx" function button, and finally, provide the value of 'x' to compute the result.
