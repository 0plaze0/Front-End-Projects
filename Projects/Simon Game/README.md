## Objective of my project

- Simon Game 

## What task does it do? 

- The task of the Simon game challenge is to reproduce the sequence of colors and sounds shown to the player. The player's goal is to repeat the exact sequence, which gradually becomes longer and more complex as the game progresses. The challenge tests the player's memory as well as his ability to recall and reproduce a given pattern.

- The game will start with a sequence of colors and sounds played by the computer, which the player must then repeat. The player's input is compared with the original string, and if it matches, the game moves on to the next level with the extended sequence. If the player moves incorrectly, the game ends, and their score is displayed.

Overall, the Simon Game Challenge provides a fun way to practice and improve memory skills.
