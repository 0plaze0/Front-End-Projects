# PROJECT NAME AND INTRO:
  
# TALKING CHATBOT -
This is a very simple "chatbot" for normal conversation using nothing but JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. I put this in quotes because chatbots these days are way more complex - this is an exercise in JS loops and conditionals, not AI.

# Tech Stack:
HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT 

# Snapshot of the website:

# Contributor:

I hope it makes a good intro for anyone interested in chatbots and frontend fundamentals.

Enjoy!
