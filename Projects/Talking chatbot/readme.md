# Project name and introduction :
# TALKING CHATBOT -
This is a very simple "chatbot" which can do normal conversation by using nothing but JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. I put this in quotes because chatbots these days are way more complex - this is an exercise in JS loops and conditionals, not AI.

# TECH STACK :
HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT

# SNAPSHOT OF THE WEBSITE :

I hope it makes a good intro for anyone interested in chatbots and frontend fundamentals.

Enjoy!
